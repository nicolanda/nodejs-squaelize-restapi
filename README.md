### practice with node-sequelize postgress and conection with azure

This repository is only for practice purposes

in this case, I use a simple example with two tables create in Postgres then using the library sequelize for building the project.

Things to keep in mind.
  
  - You need a BD running for the correct operation (in this case I use postgreSQL)
  - The tables have a one-to-many relationship (projects 1 ->  * tasks)
  - I provided an example text with the environment variables just fill the blank spot between '' and extract the .env to the root;
