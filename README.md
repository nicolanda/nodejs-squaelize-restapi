### practice with node-sequelize postgress and conection with azure

This reposistory is only for practice purposes

in this case, I use a simple example with two tables create in postgres then using the library sequelize for building the project.

things to keep in mind.
  
  - You need a BD running for the correct operation (in this case I use postgreSQL)
  - the tables has a one to many relationship (projects 1 ->  * tasks)
  - I provided a example text with the enviorment variables just fill the blank spot between '' and extract the .env to the root;
